# Description

Google Glass is a device similar to a pair of glasses, which fixed on one eye, provides a small screen above the field of view. The small screen presents its user with maps, music options, weather forecast, map routes, and in addition, it is also possible to make video calls or take pictures of something that is being seen and shared immediately over the internet.

The Project had been maintained by Google X offices since at least 2006, and until April 4, 2012, Google Glass was still a secret Google project. Currently, Google X is supported by high-tech experts like Richard W. DeVaul and Babak Parviz. The look of Google Glass looks sophisticated and futuristic but has no lenses on both sides. It is known that Google has provided the prototypes to its employees in order to be able to launch the product later this year (2014)

The Google Glass projection lens does not occupy the entire field of view of the user and has a focus technology that allows the viewer to read its content without the need to change their focus of view. All these precautions guarantee the comfort and safety of the person using the technology.

Since May 13 (2014), Google Glass has been sold to the general public, but only to those who live in the United States. The device costs $ 1,500 and the sale is part of the Glass Explorer Program, which is still in beta. Google Glass was only available to developers or people who had a project with the device. [1]

A month earlier, Google sold the glasses for 24 hours. The number of devices was limited and it was still necessary to answer a form to participate in the Glass Explorer Program. Within 20 hours all Google Glass stock was sold. [2]

And on January 19, 2016, the 'Glass Explorer Program' comes to an end, consequently suspending sales of the current model of the device indefinitely. [3]
